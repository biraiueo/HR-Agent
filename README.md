## ✨ Key Features

- **📧 Automatic Email Processing**: Scans Gmail inboxes to detect new job application emails
- **📄 Smart Resume Extraction**: Extracts text only from PDF attachments, ignoring email body text
- **🤖 AI-Powered Screening**: Uses Google's advanced AI models (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to analyze and assess resume suitability against job descriptions
- **📅 Automated Scheduling**: Automatically schedules interviews in Google Calendar for qualified candidates
- **💾 Automatic Data Recording**: Saves processed candidate data, including AI-generated resume summaries, to Google Sheets

## 🔄 Program Workflow

The program is designed to run continuously. When executed, it performs the following steps:

1. **Detect Applications**: Uses Google Gmail API to search for unread emails with subject "Job Application"
2. **Extract Information**: Downloads and extracts text from PDF attachments, identifying candidate name and email
3. **AI Screening**: Analyzes extracted resume text to determine suitability level (VERY SUITABLE, SUITABLE, or LESS SUITABLE)
4. **Take Action**:
   - **Candidate Passes**: For VERY SUITABLE or SUITABLE candidates, finds available slots in Google Calendar, schedules interview, and sends invitation email
   - **Candidate Rejected**: For LESS SUITABLE candidates, sends automatic rejection email
5. **Record Data**: Automatically records candidate data, interview schedules, and resume summaries in Google Sheets

## 🛠️ Installation and Configuration

### 1. Credential Preparation

- **Google API Key**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is stored in the `.env` file. Replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual API key
- **Google OAuth 2.0**: The `credentials.json` file from Google Cloud Console. Keep the filename as `credentials.json` in the main project folder
- **Google Sheets ID**: In `hr_agent_real.py`, find the `SPREADSHEET_ID` variable and replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID` with your actual Google Sheet ID
- **token.json**: This file is automatically generated during first run. It enables interaction with Google APIs without re-authentication

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
Grant all necessary access permissions when prompted during first run

### 2. Dependency Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, create one with these libraries:
```bash
google-api-python-client
google-auth-oauthlib
langchain
langchain-google-genai
PyMuPDF
Flask
