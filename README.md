# TalentFlow AI Agent

TalentFlow AI Agent is an automated assistant designed to accelerate the recruitment process. This project uses Google API integration and AI models to automate manual tasks, from detecting new job applications to scheduling interviews and storing candidate data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üìß Automatic Email Processing**: Scans Gmail inboxes to detect new job application emails
- **üìÑ Smart Resume Extraction**: Extracts text only from PDF attachments, ignoring email body text
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Screening**: Uses Google's advanced AI models (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to analyze and assess resume suitability against job descriptions
- **üìÖ Automated Scheduling**: Automatically schedules interviews in Google Calendar for qualified candidates
- **üíæ Automatic Data Recording**: Saves processed candidate data, including AI-generated resume summaries, to Google Sheets

## üîÑ Program Workflow

The program is designed to run continuously. When executed, it performs the following steps:

1. **Detect Applications**: Uses Google Gmail API to search for unread emails with subject "Job Application"
2. **Extract Information**: Downloads and extracts text from PDF attachments, identifying candidate name and email
3. **AI Screening**: Analyzes extracted resume text to determine suitability level (VERY SUITABLE, SUITABLE, or LESS SUITABLE)
4. **Take Action**:
   - **Candidate Passes**: For VERY SUITABLE or SUITABLE candidates, finds available slots in Google Calendar, schedules interview, and sends invitation email
   - **Candidate Rejected**: For LESS SUITABLE candidates, sends automatic rejection email
5. **Record Data**: Automatically records candidate data, interview schedules, and resume summaries in Google Sheets

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Configuration

### 1. Credential Preparation

- **Google API Key**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is stored in the `.env` file. Replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual API key
- **Google OAuth 2.0**: The `credentials.json` file from Google Cloud Console. Keep the filename as `credentials.json` in the main project folder
- **Google Sheets ID**: In `hr_agent_real.py`, find the `SPREADSHEET_ID` variable and replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID` with your actual Google Sheet ID
- **token.json**: This file is automatically generated during first run. It enables interaction with Google APIs without re-authentication

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: 
- Never upload `token.json` or `credentials.json` to GitHub or share them
- Grant all necessary access permissions when prompted during first run

### 2. Dependency Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, create one with these libraries:
```bash
google-api-python-client
google-auth-oauthlib
langchain
langchain-google-genai
PyMuPDF
Flask
python-dotenv
python-dateutil
```
### How To Run
After completing all configurations, run the program:
```bash
python api.py
```
